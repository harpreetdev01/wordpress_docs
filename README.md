Typography font scaling:
To create a style guide for font sizes, do you find the hero(heading) font size and then go.from there?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, that’s a very effective way to start a font size scale — by choosing your hero (or largest heading) font size first, then working down from there using a type scale.

Here's a practical approach:
✅ 1. Start with the hero size
Pick a font size that feels right for your most important text — usually the main headline or hero text. This could be something like 48px, 64px, or even larger depending on the design and screen size.

Example:
Hero (H1) = 64px

✅ 2. Choose a base body size
Most UI designs use 16px or 18px as a body font base. This should be readable at all screen sizes and used for paragraphs, form labels, etc.

Example:
Body = 16px

✅ 3. Pick a type scale
Use a modular scale to create the rest of your headings. Common ratios include:

Minor Third (1.2)

Major Third (1.25)

Perfect Fourth (1.333)

Golden Ratio (1.618)

You can use a modular scale calculator to generate consistent font sizes.

Example (starting from 16px, Perfect Fourth scale 1.333):

Body: 16px

H6: 21px

H5: 28px

H4: 37px

H3: 49px

H2: 65px

H1: 86px

✅ 4. Adjust for hierarchy and use case
Once you’ve generated the scale, tweak it slightly if needed to:

Keep mobile readability in mind

Maintain a visual hierarchy

Adjust for line-height and font-weight

✅ 5. Document your scale
Create a guide like:

scss
Copy code
// Example font size tokens
--font-size-body: 16px;
--font-size-h6: 21px;
--font-size-h5: 28px;
--font-size-h4: 37px;
--font-size-h3: 49px;
--font-size-h2: 65px;
--font-size-h1: 86px;
--font-size-hero: 120px;
Summary
✅ Yes — start with the hero font size (top of your hierarchy), then create a type scale down to your body text. Adjust for balance and readability, then lock it in as your system.

Hero image:
Find an image which reflects the message being convyed. 
1. Process of working with the company - clients get to view. A behind-the-scenes view
2. Face of the brand
3. Product focused image
4. Benefits focused image - what benefit the client gets by working with you
5. Grab attention: humans view shapes first and then words so need a strong image
6. Set the mood - create the atmosphere: actions
7. High quality
8. Leave space for text - if image is busy you cant read the text or CTA
9. Match your brand

All images must reflect brand personality -tone, and feel
